# Tools Install

These are setup scripts for tools, SDKs and other things I want on a new system.

The should be safe to run at any time. Where possible I install via APT, or from an 'official' remote setup script
URL. Where binaries are downloaded and un-tarred directly, they will be placed in `~/.local/bin`
